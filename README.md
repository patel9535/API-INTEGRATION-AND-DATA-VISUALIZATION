Task Description:
This project demonstrates how to integrate a public RESTful API (OpenWeatherMap) using Python to fetch real-time weather forecast data and visualize it using powerful data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

The task involves three main components:

API Integration:
Using the requests library, weather forecast data is retrieved from the OpenWeatherMap API by providing a valid API key and the name of the target city (in this case, "Canada"). The API returns a JSON response containing detailed weather information including temperature, humidity, and time of forecast.

Data Parsing:
The JSON data is parsed to extract specific informationâ€”timestamps and corresponding temperatures. These values are stored in separate lists for visualization purposes.

Data Visualization:
The extracted temperature data is visualized using Seaborn (built on Matplotlib). A line plot is generated showing temperature trends across the upcoming forecast dates, with proper labeling, rotation for readability, and grid for clarity.

ools & Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used:

requests for API integration

matplotlib.pyplot for plotting

seaborn for enhanced data visualization

API Source: OpenWeatherMap Forecast API

 Platform Used:
Development Environment: VS Code

Tested On: Windows 11 (can run on any OS with Python installed)

Real-World Applications:
Weather Monitoring Dashboard: This project can be extended into a real-time weather dashboard for cities around the world.

Educational Projects: Great for teaching students how to use RESTful APIs and visualize dynamic data.

Data Journalism: Useful for media outlets that want to display climate data trends visually.

Smart Systems: Can be embedded into smart home applications where automated systems react based on weather (e.g., heating or cooling based on forecast).

Mobile or Web Apps: Forms the backend logic for weather-based apps and widgets.

Conclusion:
This project effectively showcases how to connect to a real-world API, parse structured JSON data, and transform it into meaningful visual insights. By combining data from the OpenWeatherMap API with Python's data handling and visualization capabilities, the task builds a foundation for more complex data-driven applications. This is a strong example of using external data sources and presenting the information in a user-friendly, graphical format that can be understood at a glance.
